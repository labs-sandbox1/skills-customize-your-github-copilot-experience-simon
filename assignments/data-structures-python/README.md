# 📘 Assignment: Data Structures in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to use Python's built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Practice creating, modifying, and accessing these structures to solve real-world problems.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Working with Lists

#### Description
Write Python code to create and manipulate lists. Practice adding, removing, and accessing elements, as well as using list methods.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a list of at least 5 items
- Add and remove elements from the list
- Access elements by index and slice
- Use at least two list methods (e.g., append, sort)

### 🛠️ Using Dictionaries

#### Description
Create a dictionary to store key-value pairs. Practice adding, updating, and retrieving values, and iterating over keys and values.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs
- Add a new key-value pair
- Update an existing value
- Iterate and print all keys and values

### 🛠️ Sets and Tuples

#### Description
Work with sets to store unique items and tuples for immutable sequences. Practice set operations and tuple unpacking.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a set and add/remove items
- Demonstrate set operations (union, intersection)
- Create a tuple and access its elements
- Unpack a tuple into variables
